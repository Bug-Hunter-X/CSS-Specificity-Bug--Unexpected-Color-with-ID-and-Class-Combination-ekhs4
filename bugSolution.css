The solution involves understanding CSS specificity and ensuring that the most specific rule takes precedence.  While the combination of `#myElement.myElement` seems logical, it might not always behave as expected. A more robust solution uses more explicit and specific selectors.

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myElement {
  color: red;
}

/* Improved solution: ensures green is applied with higher specificity. */
#myElement.myElement {
  color: green !important;
}
```

Using `!important` forces the green color to be applied, bypassing any potential specificity conflicts. However, using `!important` is generally discouraged due to its potential to lead to maintainability issues.  A better solution is to avoid the conflict altogether by creating a unique selector that is more specific, such as using a more specific class or avoiding the class entirely if the id suffices.
