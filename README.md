# CSS Specificity Bug: Unexpected Color with ID and Class Combination

This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS specificity issue related to the unexpected color rendering when combining ID and class selectors with conflicting styles.

## Bug Description

The primary issue is that the expected green color for the element with both the id `myElement` and the class `myElement` is not always rendered correctly due to the behavior of the browser's specificity rules. The resulting color might be either blue or red, depending on the order of the stylesheets or browser-specific handling of conflicting styles.

## Bug Reproduction

1.  Open `bug.css` and observe the conflicting styles.
2.  Create an HTML file with an element that has both the ID `myElement` and the class `myElement`.
3.  Link to `bug.css` in your HTML file.
4.  Observe the rendered color of the element; it may not be the expected green.

## Solution

The solution involves understanding the specificity of CSS selectors and ensuring that the style with the highest specificity overrides conflicting styles.
